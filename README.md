# In this project, my goal was to build a model which would predict the prices of bulldozers.
# The data is downloaded from Kaggle bulldozers competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview
# The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

# More details - in .ipynb file
